# 3D Data Structure Visualization

A real-time 3D visualization tool for various data structures using React, Three.js, and Vite. This project provides an interactive way for users to visualize and understand how data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees work, with animations and user input support.

## Features

- Real-time 3D visualization of data structures.
- User selection of data structures (Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, etc.).
- Dynamic operations:
  - **Push/Pop** for Stack.
  - **Enqueue/Dequeue** for Queue.
  - Add/Delete nodes for Linked List and Trees.
- Real-time sorting and updates for relevant data structures.
- Smooth animations for every operation.
- Interactive 3D environment with camera controls (rotate, zoom, pan).
- Textured background and ground for a realistic environment.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework for building the UI.
- **Vite**: Fast development build tool for React.
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering and animations.
- **@react-three/fiber**: React renderer for Three.js.
- **@react-three/drei**: Useful helpers and abstractions for Three.js in React.
